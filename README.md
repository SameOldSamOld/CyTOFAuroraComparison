# CyTOFAuroraComparison

This GitHub page contains several scripts addressing reviewer comments in regard to a comparison between CyTOF and Aurora data

## Code to create figure 1d

![Figure 1d](https://github.com/SameOldSamOld/CyTOFAuroraComparison/blob/master/data/fig1d.pdf) was used to visualise the percentage of 11 cell populations as estimated through the use of CyTOF and Spectral cytometry technologies.

*plotPCCounts.R* is the R code used to create figure 1d using ggplot2. It uses the data from */data/percountCounts.csv* to reproduce figure 1d.

*/data/percountCounts.csv* is the dataset with raw values used to calculate 95% confidence interval as requested by reviewers.

You can run this code by copy pasting this code into the RStudio Console:

    eval(parse("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SameOldSamOld/CyTOFAuroraComparison/master/plotPCCounts_figure1d.R"))

## Code to generate Concordance Correlation Coefficient

![The concordance correlation coefficient plot](/data/ccc_plot.pdf) was generated to calculate a coefficient for similar markers between CyTOF and Aurora technologies. The following code may be used to reproduce this value.

*ccc_plot.R* was used to calculate the concordance correlation coefficient.

You can run this code by copy pasting this code into the RStudio Console:

    eval(parse("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SameOldSamOld/CyTOFAuroraComparison/master/ccc_plot.R"))

## Code to calculate and plot F-scores

F-scores from the FlowSOM package were used to assess the effect of increasing the number of clusters used in each Self Organising Map generation. 

To run this code you will need the raw dataset included in /data/. Follow these steps to run this code in R

1) Download this GitHub repository

2) Unzip the folder and open *FlowSOM-Fscore.R* in RStudio

3) Click Source or âŒ˜:arrow_up:S

The algorithm will calculate 48 Self Organising Maps and can take at least 10 minutes to run.
